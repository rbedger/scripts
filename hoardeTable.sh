# SYNOPSIS
#
# sometimes you come upon a useful table on the interwebz that you'd like to reference,
#             but it's buried deep within the author's drivel
#
# this tool allows you to locally persist the reference data that you are interested in
# in the form of an HTML page, which utilizes DataTables for search/sort/stripe
#
#######################################################################################
# USAGE
#
#   * use your browser's dev tools to copy the outerHTML of the table in question
#   * save it to a temporary file.  you may also pass it via STDIN, however you may need
#       to tweak the HTML slightly anyway to get it to work with DataTables, so best bet
#       is to save to a scratch file.
#   * from a terminal:
#       hoardeTable < input.html > output.html
#
#       alternatively,
#       <some previous process> | hoardeTable > output.html
#
#       alternatively,
#       hoardeTable $tableHTML > output.html
#
#######################################################################################
# CAVEATS
#
# DataTables can be finnicky, which is why this script removes all HTML attributes
# from your source prior to init'ing the table.  One important thing to note is that
# all tables must have a <thead> in order to function with DataTables.  When you supply
# a table which does not have a <thead> one will be created for you, the first
# <tr> element of the <tbody> will be assumed to contain the table headers (oftentimes true),
# and the <tr> will be removed from the <tbody> and placed into the <thead>.  Didn't turn
# out the way you wanted it to? time to roll up ur sleeves ðŸª 
#
#######################################################################################
# REMARKS
#
# NO GUARANTEE is made with regard to the functioning of third party resources:
#   * DataTables:       https://datatables.net/
#   * Material Design:  https://m2.material.io/
#   * jQuery:           https://code.jquery.com
#
# stylesheets and javascript resources are linked dynamically.  for a fully functional,
# offline hoarde, you should download all .css and .js resources.
